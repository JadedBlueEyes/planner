## Data Storage

Task and project data is stored in a local SQLite database (`planner.db`) in the root directory of the project.

### Database Setup

After installation, run the migrations to set up the database:

```bash
pnpm run db:migrate
```

### Database Configuration

By default, the database file is created at `./planner.db` in the project root. You can customize the location by setting the `SQLITE_DB_PATH` environment variable:

```bash
SQLITE_DB_PATH=/path/to/your/database.db
```

### Database Schema

The project uses Drizzle ORM with SQLite. To generate new migrations after schema changes:

```bash
pnpm run db:generate
```

To view and edit the database with Drizzle Studio:

```bash
pnpm run db:studio
```
